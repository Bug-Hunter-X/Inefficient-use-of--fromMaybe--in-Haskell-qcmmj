This repository demonstrates an uncommon but potential performance issue in Haskell related to the use of `fromMaybe` from the `Data.Maybe` module.  The example shows a scenario where using `fromMaybe` might introduce unnecessary overhead compared to a more direct approach. The solution provides an alternative implementation that directly addresses the `Maybe` value to improve efficiency. This is particularly relevant when dealing with performance-critical sections or extensive computations.
